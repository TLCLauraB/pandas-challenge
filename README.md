# Homework Repo for Challenge 4

## Author: Laura Bishop

## Overview

I received help and support from my fellow Data Vis classmates via our Discord Server (both through voice chat and text), as well as our class-provided Slack Channel. I regularly attend both before- and after-class Office Hours to engage the materials with the Instructor and TAs.

I rewatched several of the classes from Module 4 using the Zoom recordings found at BSC > Zoom > Cloud Recordings. In conjunction with that, I re-reviewed the Module 3 and 4 Instructor Demos provided through GitLab.

I used the Python code as per the module and utilized Pandas as a functions library. I debugged using Jupyter Notebooks and made sure to convert the files back over to Python to ensure total compliance with the homework assignment. I included both Jupyter Notebooks and Python Files for review, along with any README documentation.

What are...
`Test for Success`
These were milestone tests I used to make sure the functions I was building were performing as desired before incorporating into the whole.

`DEBUGGING`
When something would break, I would go back and run alternative methods of a section until I found a solution that matched the example.

I utilized the following resources:
